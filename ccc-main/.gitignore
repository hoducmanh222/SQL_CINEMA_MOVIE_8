# According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
# However, in case of collaboration, if the project uses a library that has an incompatible dependency
# or if there is a need to enforce a specific version of a library, it is recommended to exclude Pipfile.lock.
